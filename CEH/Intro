Top security attack vectors
    - cloud computing threats
        flaw in one client's application cloud allows attackers to access other client's data
    - advanced persistent threats
        stealing information from the victim machine
    - viruses and worms
        capable of infecting a network within seconds
    - ransomware
        restricts access and demands ransom
    - mobile threats
        mobiles have lesser security making them more vulnerable 
    - botnet
        a huge network of compromosed systems used to perform network attacks 
    - insider attacks 
        an attack performed by an entrusted person on a corporate network 
    - phishing 
        illegitimate email falsely claiming to be legitimate to steal personal information 
    - web application threats 
        attackers target web applications to steal credentials and other information the user might have saved 
    - IoT threats    
        IoT devices have software applications that are used to access the device remotely, flaws here allow remote access to an attacker 

Types of attacks
    - Operating System Attacks 
        Buffer overlow, bugs in OS, unpatched OS vulnerabilities
    - Misconfiguration Attacks 
        Misconfiguration of web servers, application platforms, databases, networks, or frameworks
    - Application Level Attacks 
        Exploiting vulnerabilities in applications running on the information systems
        Buffer overflow, cross-site scripting, MITM, DOS, session hijacking, etc

Hacking Phases
    - Reconnaissance
        refers to the preparatory phase where attacker seeks to gather information about a target
        could be a future point of return, noited for ease of entry when target is known on a broader scale
        reconnaissance target scale may include clients, employees, oprations, network and, systems

        Types of reconnaissance 
            - Passive
                without directly interacting with the target  
                searching public records and new releases  
            - Active  
                interacting directly with the target  
                telephone calls to the help desk or technical department  
  
        Pre-Attack Phase  
            Scanning refers to the pre-attack phase where attaker scans the network on the   basis of info gathered during recon   
          
        Port Scanner   
        Extract Information  
      
    - Gaining Access   
        Refers to the point where attacks obtains access to the operating system   
        obtains access to the OS, system level application level, or network level  
        attacker escalates privileges to obtain complete control of the system   
  
    - Maintaining Access  
        Refers when the attacks tries to retain the ownership of the system   
        using backdoors, rootkits or trojans  
        attackers can upload, download, or manipulate data, applications, and configurations  
        can use the system to lauch further attacks  
  
  
Questions for ethical hackers   
    What can the intruder see on the target system?   
    What can an intruder do with that information?  
    Does annyone at the target notice the intruders' attempts or success?  
    If all the compoonents of information system are adequately protected, updated and   patched?  
  

Information Security Management Program
    combination of well-defined policies, processes, procedures, standards, and guidelines to establish the required level of information security

    Security Policy

Enterprise Information Security Arrchitecture (EISA)
    set of requirements, processes, principles, and models that determine the structure and behavior of and org's information systems 
        - helps in monitoring and detecing network behaviors in real time
        - detects and revocers from security breaches
        - resource prioritizing resources 
        - paying attention to various threats
        - cost benefit regarding incident response, disaster recovery, event correlation
        - procedure analysis for proper functioning and asset identification


Network Security Zoning

    to manage a secure network environment
    effective control of inbound and outbound traffic

    Internet Zone
        Uncontrolled, outisde the boundaries or an org 
    
    Internet DMZ (Demiliterized Zone)
        Controlled zone, provides a barrier between interal and internet

    Production Network Zone
        Restricted Zone, controls direct access from uncontrolled networks 

    Intranet Zone 
        Controlled zone, no heavy restrictions

    Management Network Zone
        Secured zone, strict policies

        - updated regularly
    Prudent Policy 
        - max security, but allows known but necessary dangers 
        - blocks all services 
        - only safe and necessary services are allowed
