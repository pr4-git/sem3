routing table only has best path 

router selects the best path to forward a data packet based on the following criteria
    - longest prefix 
        Eg: /32 > /24
    - lower AD (administrative distance)
        Eg: EIGRP(90) > OSPF(110)
    - lower metric (distance basically)
        Eg: 50 > 100

types of route 
    * static 
        - manually configured 
        - AD is 1
        - used in small network and for dedicated service
        - always best 
        - need to configure in both requesting router and replying router 
    * default 
        - 
    * dynamic

    virtual interface so that extra routers are not required
