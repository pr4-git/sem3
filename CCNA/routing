routing table only has best path 

router selects the best path to forward a data packet based on the following criteria
    - longest prefix 
        Eg: /32 > /24
    - lower AD (administrative distance)
        Eg: EIGRP(90) > OSPF(110)
    - lower metric (distance basically)
        Eg: 50 > 100

types of route 
    * static 
        - manually configured 
        - AD is 1
        - used in small network and for dedicated service
        - always best 
        - need to configure in both requesting router and replying router 
    * default 
        - 
    * dynamic
        - forms a neighborship between routers  
        * RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
            - distance vector routing protocol 
                - uses hop count for primary metric 
            - maximum hop count = 15
                - more than 16 routers means RIP doesn't work 
            - AD 120 
            - each rip router maintains a routing table 
            - uses 520/udp port
            - broadcasts every 30 seconds to update the topology

            TIMINGS 
                - update timer : 30 seconds
                if no update,
                - invalid timer : 180 seconds 
                again, if no response,
                - hold down timer : 180 seconds 
                still not, 
                - flush timer : 240 seconds (180 hold + 60 flush) 

                Types of RIP
                    - v1
                        - classful (default subnet masks)
                        - no summarization 
                        - no authentication
                        - not secure
                        - broadcast 

                    - v2
                        - classless (non-default subnet masks)
                        - can summarize
                        - authentication
                        - more secure 
                        - multicast

        * EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
            - advanced distance vector routing protocol 
            - no tcp or udp, port 88 
            - AD
                - 5 for summary
                - 90 for internal 
                - 170 for external
            - only routing protocol that supports both equal and unequal cost load balance 
            

            Q. Why is EIGRP advanced distance vector routing protocol?

            Q. What is the difference between distance vector routing protocol and advanced distance routing protocol?

            Q. Differentiate between distance vector and link state.

            - AS (Autonomous System) is a network or collection of networks managed & supervised by a single entity or organization.

            TIMINGS 
                - hello timer : 5 seconds
                - hold timer : 15 seconds

            Message Types: 
                - hello
                    - to initialize neighborship after successful exchange

                - ack       ]--v 
                    - to form adjacency 
                    - exchange routes
                - query 
                    - in case route/network is down 
                - reply
                    - reply for query

Metric Calculation 
    - metric weight (default values)
        - k1 = 1
        - k2 = 0
        - k3 = 1
        - k4 = 0
        - k5 = 0

    - metric component 
        - bandwidth 
        - load 
        - delay 
        - reliability 
        - MTU 

loopback interface
    virtual interface so that extra routers are not required 

Redistribute 
    to exchange the routing tables from different routing protocols, works as an external route.
