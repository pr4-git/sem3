routing table only has best path 

router selects the best path to forward a data packet based on the following criteria
    - longest prefix 
        Eg: /32 > /24
    - lower AD (administrative distance)
        Eg: EIGRP(90) > OSPF(110)
    - lower metric (distance basically)
        Eg: 50 > 100

types of route 
    * static 
        - manually configured 
        - AD is 1
        - used in small network and for dedicated service
        - always best 
        - need to configure in both requesting router and replying router 
    * default 
        - 
    * dynamic
        - forms a neighborship between routers  
        * RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
            - distance vector routing protocol 
                - uses hop count for primary metric 
            - maximum hop count = 15
                - more than 16 routers means RIP doesn't work 
            - AD 120 
            - each rip router maintains a routing table 
            - uses 520/udp port
            - broadcasts every 30 seconds to update the topology

            TIMINGS 
                - update timer : 30 seconds
                if no update,
                - invalid timer : 180 seconds 
                again, if no response,
                - hold down timer : 180 seconds 
                still not, 
                - flush timer : 240 seconds (180 hold + 60 flush) 

                Types of RIP
                    - v1
                        - classful (default subnet masks)
                        - no summarization 
                        - no authentication
                        - not secure
                        - broadcast 

                    - v2
                        - classless (non-default subnet masks)
                        - can summarize
                        - authentication
                        - more secure 
                        - multicast                 

loopback interface
    virtual interface so that extra routers are not required
