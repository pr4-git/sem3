routing table only has best path 

router selects the best path to forward a data packet based on the following criteria
    - longest prefix 
        Eg: /32 > /24
    - lower AD (administrative distance)
        Eg: EIGRP(90) > OSPF(110)
    - lower metric (distance basically)
        Eg: 50 > 100

types of route 
    * static 
        - manually configured 
        - AD is 1
        - used in small network and for dedicated service
        - always best 
        - need to configure in both requesting router and replying router 
    * default 
        - 
    * dynamic
        - forms a neighborship between routers  
        * RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
            - distance vector routing protocol 
                - uses hop count for primary metric 
            - maximum hop count = 15
                - more than 16 routers means RIP doesn't work 
            - AD 120 
            - each rip router maintains a routing table 
            - uses 520/udp port
            - broadcasts every 30 seconds to update the topology

            TIMINGS 
                - update timer : 30 seconds
                if no update,
                - invalid timer : 180 seconds 
                again, if no response,
                - hold down timer : 180 seconds 
                still not, 
                - flush timer : 240 seconds (180 hold + 60 flush) 

                Types of RIP
                    - v1
                        - classful (default subnet masks)
                        - no summarization 
                        - no authentication
                        - not secure
                        - broadcast 

                    - v2
                        - classless (non-default subnet masks)
                        - can summarize
                        - authentication
                        - more secure 
                        - multicast - 224.0.0.9

        * EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
            - advanced distance vector routing protocol 
            - no tcp or udp, port 88 
            - AD
                - 5 for summary
                - 90 for internal 
                - 170 for external
            UNEQUAL COST LOAD BALANCE
                - it's the only routing protocol that supports both equal and unequal cost load balance 
                - using an sapect of eigrp called variance (by default its value is 1)
            

            Q. Why is EIGRP advanced distance vector routing protocol?

            Q. What is the difference between distance vector routing protocol and advanced distance routing protocol?

            Q. Differentiate between distance vector and link state. (answer is in ospf pdf)

            - AS (Autonomous System) is a network or collection of networks managed & supervised by a single entity or organization.

            TIMINGS 
                - hello timer : 5 seconds
                - hold timer : 15 seconds

            Message Types: 
                - hello
                    - to initialize neighborship after successful exchange 
                - update    ]
                - ack       ]--v 
                    - to form adjacency 
                    - exchange routes

            Metric Calculation 
                - metric weight (default values)
                    - k1 = 1
                    - k2 = 0
                    - k3 = 1
                    - k4 = 0
                    - k5 = 0

        * OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) [most important apparently]
            - full topology database 
            - not tcp or udp, port 89 
            - classless 
            - multicast 224.0.0.5
            - uses cost for best path 
            - for neighborship
                - not necessary that process ID be same
                - area must be same
                - authentication must be same 
                - subnet mask must be same in case of ethernet, not necessary in serial cable
                - hello and dead interval times must match (depends on the network)
                - router id must be unique 
                    assigned based on the following criteria:
                    - manual 
                    - highest loopback ip
                    - highest interface ip 
                - stub flag must be same 
                - mtu must be same (at the first connection, or until restart)

                - init

            Types of area 
                - backbone : 0
                - non-backbone : all except 0 

            area 0 is required for route exchange, whether it be physical or virtual


            DR / BDR (Designated Router / Backup Designated Router)
                to prevent flooding in network 
                criteria:
                    - highest priority (default 1, up to 255)
                    - highest router-id (loopback has higher priority)
                second highest becomes BDR 
                others become DRother

                40 seconds election timer
                    - router added after election timer doesn't become DR/BDR
                    - process clear is required for re-election 
                DR will flood multicast to 224.0.0.6 
                DRothers will esnd multicast to 224.0.0.5
                
            Types of router 
                - Backbone Router: area 0
                - Area Router: any area
                - Area Border Router: one interface must be in area 0, others can be in any 
                - Autonomous System Boundary Router: router which exchanges routing tables between different protocols 

            Q. Why is OSPF link state routing protocol?

            LSA (link state advertisevment)
                determines how the routes are stored in a database
                1 - Router LSA
                    generated by each router for each area 
                    

loopback interface
    virtual interface so that extra routers are not required 

Redistribute 
    to exchange the routing tables from different routing protocols, works as an external route.
