etherchannel
port link aggregation technology
even links are physically separate, they're logically the same
there is no loop in this case as an etherchannel does not broadcast in its own channel
max 8 links
bandwith or the link must be same

    two types of protocol
        - PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol) (Cisco Proprietary)
            two modes
                - auto
                - desirable
                auto x auto - can't
                auto x des - can
                des x des - can
                desirable will initialize, auto will negotiate
        - LACP (IEEE Link Aggregation Protocol) (Industry Standard)
            two modes 
                - active ~ desirable
