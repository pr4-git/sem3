Vlan Trunking Protocol
    used to manage vlan 
    cisco proprietary 
    vlan information like ID, name can be synchrolized with switches inside the same VTP domain

    VTP criteria:
        * domain - same [default: null]
        * version - same 
            version 1
                - range 1-1005
                - password in plaintext or MD5
            
            version 2
                - extended vlan can be created but in transparent mode
                - secure password storage

            version 3
                - can create extended vlan 
                - secure password storage and management

        * authentication/password - same [optional]

    Modes 
        - Server
            create and delete vlan 
        - Client
            cannot create and delete vlan 
        - Transparent
            create and delete but locally (local database)

            suppose there are 4 swithces as S1, C2, T3 and S4 
            when S1 creates a vlan 2, C2 and S4 gets updated 
            when vlan 2 is deleted by S2, it is deleted in C2 and S4 also
            when T3 creates a vlan 10, it is not updated in the other switches
            T3 also doesn't get update from S1 and S4 creations and deletions

        configuration revision (CR) updates every time changes are made in server, similar to a change counter 
        when adding new swtiches to the network, make sure to change the domain name or mode to transparent, so that the network doesn't go down due to a CR mismatch
        on changing those, the CR value is reset and can be updated according to the production network
