There are 3 modes of operation:

1. user-exec mode (restrictive)

   - we cannot perform any kind of configuration command
   - we can only execute certain show commands
   - it is denoted by ">"

2. privilege-exec mode (administrative)

  - we can administrate switch or router through this mode - we can execute every available command
  - it is denoted by "#"
  - to go into privilege-exec mode, "enable" should be typed in user-exec mode

3. global configuration mode

  - in order to commit any command, we must commit those command via global communication mode
  - to go into this mode, "configure terminal" should be typed in privilege-exec
  - "exit" command is used to go back a level
  - if ctrl-z is used here, it goes back to privilege-exec mode

  There are two configuration types -

  1. Running Configuration

     - stays in volatile memory

  2. Startup Configuration

     - latest saved copy of running config is stored here
     - stays in non-volatile memory

  CISCO PACKET TRACER:
  CLI commands for router configuration: enable > config terminal > interface {port no.} > ip address {ip address} {subnet mask} > no shutdown
  can go directly from one interface to another
  after that you need to "write" in admin mode (or copy running-config startup-config)

  other command to show details about ports in router: show ip interface brief

  how to add password for admin: 
    - go to global 
    - enable secret {password} 
    - after exiting, password is required to enter admin mode

  remove blank line with no prompt after shut / no shut: 
    - line console 0 
    - logging synchronous

  configure routing (in configure terminal) 
    - sho ip route 
    - router eigrp ? 
    - router eigrp <autonomous system number>
      AS number should be same in both router
      1-64511 for global use and 64512-65535 for private and reserved > THEN SEND NETWORK ADVERTISEMENT 
    - network <ip addr> <wildcard bits>
      here wildcard bits is taken by subtracting subnet mask from 255 - no auto

      this should be done for both router

  to enable IPv6 (in global config mode) 
    - ipv6 unicast-routing 
    - {go to any interface} 
    - ipv6 add {ip address}/{prefix length} 
    - no shut 
    - show ipv6 int brief {for ip interface}

      - [in PC you can use automatic because of EUI]

  Some codes
  line - Configure a terminal line
  console - primary terminal line
  aux - auxiliary line

  to set password for console port (global) 
    - line console 0 
    - password {this sets password} 
    - login {this starts asking for password} 
    - exit 
    - do write {"copy running-config startup-config" can also be used}

  to set password for enable (global)
    - enable password <password>
  this sets plaintext password 
    - enable secret <password>
  this sets password in hash

  to enable encryption {global} 
    - service password-encryption

  to disable... translating in router (global) 
    - no ip domain-lookup
  this disables domain lookup in router, translating... stops

  use description command on interface to add a description to the interface
  "show interface" shows this description

  ssh configuration (global)
    - ip domain-name {name}
    - crypto key generate rsa
    - default value is 512
    - you can do show ip ssh to check if ssh is enabled
    - line vty 0 4
    - transport input ssh
    - password {}
    - login
    - exit
    - do write
  username {name} privilege {15} secret {}

      [to enable version 2 ssh, go to global config, ip ssh version 2 {rsa key should be 768 or more}]

      to select multiple ports, use [interface range {port numbers}]

  to check switchport mode 
    - show interface {interface} switchport

      There's two types of DTP (dynamic trunking protocols), it doesn't have security, it is a cisco proprietary protocol
        - auto
        - desirable

      to change switchport mode
        - switchport mode dynamic desirable

  native vlan is 1 by default, data sent by user in native vlan in untagged, otherwise it is tagged. it is changed as a security measure 
    - switchport trunk native vlan {vlan}

  to enable vlan in switch (global) 
    - sho vlan brief 
    - vlan {number} 
    - name {name}
    (create as many vlans as you want) 
    - exit 
    - interface range {range} 
    - switchport mode access
    access mode supports only a single vlan, trunk port supports multiple vlans 
    - switchport access vlan {vlan number}
  (do this as long as you want to put vlans)

  to remove vlan 
    - no vlan {number}

  to connect 2 switches (trunking) (global) 
    - int {port} 
    - switch mode trunk 
    - switchport trunk allow vlan {vlan numbers}

  IN THE TRUNKING VLAN
    to remove allowed vlan in trunk 
      - int {port} 
      - switchport trunk allowed vlan remove {vlan number}

    to keep just a single vlan
      - int {port}
      - switchport trunk allowed vlan {vlan number}

    to add an vlan
      - int {port}
      - switchport trunk allowed vlan add {vlan number}

    use "sho int trunk" to check vlans

  L3 switch
  ip routing : enables routing
  no switchport : removes switching, puts the port in routing mode (execute inside port interface)
  don't forget to "ip add" to assign an ip address to the port

      delete vlan.dat : removes database of all vlans (in privilege mode)

  two types of encapsulation 
    - isl (cisco proprietary) 
    - dot1q (open source, IEEE)

  in production networks 
    - int {number} 
    - switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q 
    - switchport mode trunk

  trunk in L3 
    - L3 does not allow trunk automatically 
    - int {interface}  
    - switchport trunk {? to check the commands} 
    - switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q 
    - switchport trunk allow vlan {vlan numbers} 
    - show int trunk

  - show cdp neighbors

  DHCP configuration: 
    - configure ip in a port
    [define a pool of addresses to assign, this is included in the network address] 
    - ip dhcp ?
    we will focus on pool and excluded addresses 
    - ip dhcp pool {name} 
    - goes inside the dhcp configuration menu 
    - network {network address} {mask} 
    - default-router {router ip address} 
    - dns-server {router ip, or local domain name}

      sho ip dhcp
        - binding: ip address and mac address
        - conflict: shows if conflict
        - pool: pool info

      to limit the dhcp ip from .100 to .200
        - ip dhcp excluded-address {..}.1 {..}.99
        - ip dhcp excluded-address {..}.201 {..}.254

      need to reboot router in real scenario for changes to take place

  Router on a stick model
  to configure multiple networks in a single port
  the virtual interface used for this is called sub interface

      [configure vlan and trunking in switch first]

      [global terminal in router]
      - int {port}.{arbitrary number for sub interface}
        it goes to the sub interface (config-subif)
      -  we can't add ip directly, first we have to configure encapsulation protocol
      - encapsulation dot1Q {vlan ID}
      - ip add
      - no sh

      [try to configure dhcp if you want]
      - go to main interface
      - no sh


      [on connecting two switches, check if port mode is in trunking or access]
      to fix vlan mismatch
        - go to switch connected port of new switch
        - switchport mode access
        - switchport access vlan {vlan id}
        - int range {all interfaces of switch}
        - switchport mode access
        - switchport access vlan {vlan id}

      router on a stick model allows for scalability
      network automation can be done to configure similar settings on multiple devices

  to configure static routing 
    - ip route [destination network] [subnet mask] [next hop ip]
      <doesn't drop packets even if proxies are disabled>
    , OR 
    - ip route [destination network] [subnet mask] [exit interface]
      <if proxies are disabled, packets will be dropped> 

      NOTE: in the case of ethernet cable, don't use exit interface 
            in the case of serial link, use exit interface 

  to disable proxies 
    - no ip proxy-arp 
    - shut 
    - no shut
    - clear arp cache

  for authentication
    - key chain [chain name] 
    - key-string [password] 
    - int [port number]
    - authentication rip 
    - key chain [chain name]
