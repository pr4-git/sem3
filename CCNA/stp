STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
    used in order to stop the packets from looping 
    IEEE 802.1D

    one switch is a root bridge
        all ports are forwarding 
        designated ports (DP (green)) 

        checks lower priority and bridge ID for root bridge 
        priority = 32768 (default)
        bridge ID = MAC (unique)


        RP (Root Port) (green)
            this exists in non-root bridges 
            for forwarding 

            criteria (low)
                - cost reach upto RB 
                    self explanatory
                - sender bridge ID
                    the bridge ID when it recieves packet
                    the lower sender bridge ID is taken for RP  
                - sender port ID
                    the port ID when recieving packet 
                    ex: fa0/1 is lower than fa0/2 
                    the lower port ID is taken for RP

        Alternate Blocking
            low MAC sends to high in non-root bridges 
            so the high MAC blocks its port 
        
        three types
            NC  - CISCO
            -----------
            CST - RPVST 
            STP - PVST
            MST - MST


        primary priority : defau;t - (4096 x 2)
        secondary prioity : default - (4096)
        default : default 

    to change alt block port to rp, there is two methods, decerasing cost and changing sender port id 
        when decreasing cost, it's always from non-root bridge to root bridge
        when changing sender port id, it's in the root bridge

    ports in stp are in one of 5 states 
        - blocking : 20 secs to unblock (max age timer)
        - listening - 15 secs to listen 
        - learning  - 15 secs to learn 
        - forwarding - after 50 seconds 
        - disabled 

        timer between listening to learning - forward delay timer (15 seconds)

    
    tcn - topology change notification 
        * direct
            - 30 seconds 
            - uplinkfast = the tc doesn't take time  
        * indirect  
            - 50 seconds [30 + 20 max age timing]
            - backbonefast = just takes 30 seconds (removes max age timer)

        * 
            - portfast = in access port 

    bpdu guard 
        in a switch, if a switch superior to the root bridge arrives, the port is disabled (error-disabled)
        this is done to prevent attacks
