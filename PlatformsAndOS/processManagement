A Process Control Block (PCB) is required to manage processes
    - a data structure created by OS 
    - similar to a page table storing page frame information 
    - when a program is converted into a process, a PCB is created for it by the OS 
    - used to store information / attributes of a process
    - information includes 
        - process state 
        - Process Identifier (PID) 
            - unique identifying value 
        - stack pointer 
        - program counter 
            - address of next instruction
        - CPU Registers
        - CPU scheduling information 
        - Memory management information 
        - Accounting information 
            - like a log 
        - I/O information
    
    Process States 
        minimum 5 states from creation to completion
        names aren't standardized 
        States:
            1. New
                when a program is first picked up by the main memory 
            
            2. Ready 
                after creation the process enters the ready state
                waiting for CPU to be assigned (waiting for execution)
                multiple processes can exist in this state 
            
            3. Running 
                depending on the scheduling alg of the OS, the process from ready queue are picked for execution 
                if time quanta is complete, the process is relocated into the ready queue 
                in case of a higher priority process in the ready, the running process can also be suspended  
                if there is a single CPU only a single process exists in this state
            
            4. Block/Wait 
                in case of an I/O request, a process transitions from running state to block/wait state 
                after input is recieved, the process goes back to the ready state for scheduling 
                multiple processes can exist in this state 
            
            5. Termination
                on completion of the process, it comes into the terminated state 
                it can be normal exit, fatal error exit, termination by other process
                PCB is erased
             
            
            RAM space is limited.
            if a process has spent a lot of time in wait state, resources aren't properly utilized and RAM space is wasted.
            for further optimization, some more state are introduced.

            Suspend Ready 
                process is transfered from ready to suspend ready:
                    if higher priority process comes for execution 
                    if ready queue is already packed
                once memory is free, it is sent back to ready 
                stored in secondary storage
            
            Suspend Wait 
                similar to suspend ready 
                    if required resources (I/O) are already in usa 
                    if main memory is full
                once resource is released, it is sent back
