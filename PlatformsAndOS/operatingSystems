Kernel is a piece of code in an OS that initializes hardware.

Structure of OS:
    Monolithic System 
    - entire OS runs as a single program in kernel mode
    - single large executable program, collection of multiple procedures linked
    - any procedure can call any other procedure
    - single point of failure, one bug in any procedure can crash everything
    - most basic structure of an OS

    Layered Structure
    - broken into pieces (layers)
    - bottom-most layer (layer 0) is hardware, and topmost layer (layer n) UI
    - each layer uses the functions of that under it
    - simpler debugging
    - all tasks require some level of abstraction
